# smart-cradle
Overview
The Smart Cradle project aims to create an innovative, tech-enhanced cradle for babies that ensures their safety and comfort while providing peace of mind to parents. This project integrates various sensors and technologies to monitor and adjust the cradleâ€™s environment, offering features like automated rocking, temperature control, and real-time alerts.

Features
Automated Rocking: Gentle, adjustable rocking motion to soothe your baby.
Temperature Monitoring: Real-time temperature monitoring with alerts to maintain an ideal environment.
Humidity Control: Sensors to ensure optimal humidity levels.
Real-Time Alerts: Notifications sent to your smartphone for any irregularities or required actions.
Remote Control: Operate and configure the cradle through a mobile app.
Data Logging: Historical data for temperature, humidity, and rocking patterns.
